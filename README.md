# Compiler
There are two files. The parser.cpp computes the FIRST and FOLLOW for a given grammar. And, the tokenizer.cpp generates the lastpos, firstpos, and followpos. It also generates a DFA for a given regular expression. There are some bugs in these two files, like the DFA does not always generate or there are some unknown states generated. And I have not checked the FIRST and FOLLOW for many grammars. It is a very simple program.
